    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An algorithm with better time complexity is considered more efficient in solving large-scale problems.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> defines the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means the memory it uses grows linearly with input size.
